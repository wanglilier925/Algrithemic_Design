# Algrithemic_Design
1.       Develop structured, modular algorithms
2.       Implement correct programs in an object-oriented language
3.       Use and implement as classes data structures, such as sets, bags, sequences, stacks, queues, and binary trees
4.       Analyze the time and space complexity of simple algorithms
5.       Apply data abstraction and elementary concepts of object-oriented programming
6.       Implement moderately complex programs using an object-oriented language.
